# Repeated word 
## Challenge 
Write a function called repeated word that finds the first word to occur more than once in a string
Arguments: string
Return: string

## Solution

## Code 

  public String checkRepeated(String string) throws Exception {

    String arrString[]=string.split(" ");
    HashTable<String,Integer> hashTable= new HashTable<>();
    for (String s: arrString){
      String lowerString= s.toLowerCase();
      if (hashTable.contains(lowerString))return lowerString;
      hashTable.add(lowerString,1);
    }
    return null;
  }

  ## Big(O)
  time complixty O(n) ,where n is the number of table buckets in worst case. 
  
  ## Egde cases 
  * if the word has a coma , Exclamation mark ,..
  * there is no word repeated.
  the string is only one word. 

## Tests
 
  @Test
  void doesContain() throws Exception {
      
    HashTable<String,Integer> hashTable= new HashTable<>();
    hashTable.add("Mariam" , 811);
    hashTable.add("Sara" , 811);
    hashTable.add("Yousef" , 811);
    assertEquals(false,hashTable.contains("Yousef"));
  }



  @Test
  void checkRepeatedTest() throws Exception {

    String string = "A strawberry is a strawberry";
    HashTable<String,Integer> hashTable= new HashTable<>();

    assertEquals("it", hashTable.checkRepeated("It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, " +
      "it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch " +
      "of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, " +
      "it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going " +
      "direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way â€“ in short, the period was so far like the present " +
      "period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, " +
      "in the superlative degree of comparison only..."));
  }
  @Test
  void checkSecond() throws Exception {

    String string = "A strawberry is a strawberry";
    HashTable<String,Integer> hashTable= new HashTable<>();
    assertEquals("a" ,hashTable.checkRepeated(string));
  }
